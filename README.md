# Robot_Arm_CCD
An implementation of  inverse kinematics , named Cyclic Coordinate Descent, for a 7 Dof robot arm(FRANKA EMIKA)

# Prerequisite
- Matlab

# Install   
`git clone https://github.com/HAOLI-TUKL/Robot_Arm_CCD.git`       

# Usage
1. enter the workspace
`cd src`    
2. enter the workspace
`run main.m`


# Technical Overview
* my_frontier_exploration package generates a destination(frontier) for mobile vehicle in order to approach the boundary between the explorated and unexplorated area. When multiple destinations(frontiers) can be selected, a closest one in the DFS tree would be chosen.
* my_move_base package generates a trajectory from the current position to the destination generated by my_frontier_exploration package. The trajectory can be generated based on RRT/RRT* / A* / Hybrid A*, which can be determined in the launch_all.launch. Then PID controller would be used to have the vehicle follow the trajectory.
* my_car package and my_controller mainly deals with the vehicle model and driver for the simulation in Gazebo.
